# 🥟 Samosa Selector – CodePath WEB102 Lab 2

**Samosa Selector** is a simple clicker-style web game inspired by Cookie Clicker — but with a tasty twist. Instead of clicking cookies, users select delicious samosas to rack up their count! The goal is to click the big samosa as many times as possible to increase your samosa count. This lab was built as part of **CodePath's WEB102 Lab 2**.

## 🎯 Lab Objective
This lab focuses on:
- Using **React `useState`** to manage and update component state
- Registering **`onClick` events** in a React app
- Defining and using **event handler functions**
- Practicing React fundamentals like state-driven rendering and component interaction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- ⚛️ **React** – Functional components and hooks
- ⚡ **Vite** – Development and bundling
- 🟨 **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For state logic and component behavior
- 🎨 **CSS** – For layout and style

## 🕹️ Features
- **Click Counter**: Click the samosa to increase your count
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses `useState` to reflect changes immediately
- **Simple Layout**: Designed to help reinforce the React event/state update cycle
